# Red Wine Quality Analysis

I am conducting an initial analysis of the red wine quality dataset to explore its characteristics and uncover key insights. This involves examining the dataset's structure, cleaning and preprocessing the data, and performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand feature distributions, relationships, and correlations. By analyzing variables like acidity, alcohol, and residual sugar, I aim to identify patterns that influence wine quality.

You can access the dataset on the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/186/wine+quality). It has 12 features.
